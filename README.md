## Project Idea  
We intend to build an Energy Auditing System through a combination of Bluetooth mesh
sensor nodes and a Gateway. The system will gather all the sensor node information and
send it to cloud for data analysis through Gateway.
Two Teams will collaborate to build this entire system. Our team will work on developing a
Bluetooth mesh network of wireless power meter sensor nodes that can clamp on to mains
line noninvasively. These nodes will report the measured power to the Gateway which will
be developed by the other team.

## What problem does the project solve?
Energy audit and conservation projects require measuring the existing power consumption
for the equipment under audit to create a baseline of the existing consumption. Electrical
circuits may not be isolated by the type of equipment in many buildings, this causes errors
in calculation of the power consumption of the equipment under audit, resulting in
erroneous calculation of the baseline, which in turns affects all other energy conservation
calculations. Setting up wired metering infrastructure for such temporary measurements
would be very tedious and labor intensive. Our project will help setup temporary metering
infrastructure that is not labor intensive to setup due to it being wireless and noninvasive.
